There is a wide array of documentation and help avalable 
online which covers everything from learning Python as a 
first programming language to details of how to make 
changes to the Python interpreter.

The first port of call for help is often the 
link:http://docs.python.org/index.html[official documentation], 
which includes:

* link:http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html[The Python Tutorial]
* link:http://docs.python.org/library/index.html[The Standard Library Reference]
* link:http://docs.python.org/reference/index.html[The Python Language Reference]
* link:http://docs.python.org/faq/index.html[FAQs]

This course is designed to cover much of the same material described 
by the Python Tutorial, but I have chosen not to cover the section 
on link:http://docs.python.org/tutorial/errors.html[errors and exceptions] 
or some of the fancier tools available for functional programming, packages 
and modules, and in the Standard Library. 

The starting point for documentation on SciPy and NumPy is at 
link:http://www.scipy.org/[www.scipy.org]. Key documents include:

* link:http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/[The NumPy Reference Guide]
* link:http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/[The SciPy Reference Guide]
* link:http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial[A NumPy tutorial]
* link: http://www.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users[A guide to NumPy for Matlab users]

A good way to learn how to construct graphs with Matplotlib is to look at 
the link:http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html[gallery], which 
includes the source code used to generate each plot.

There is a wide range of other documentation available. This includes the
link:http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/[Python Module of the week], an 
attempt to provide better documentation for the Standard Library and 
a number of books. I've used two when writing this course:

* Matplotlib for Python Developers. S. Tosi (2009) link:http://www.packtpub.com/matplotlib-python-development/book[Packt Publishing]

* link:http://www.rmi.net/~lutz/about-lp4e.html[Learning Python]. M. Lutz and D. Ascher. O'Reilly

I've also made use of material from 
link:http://metson.web.cern.ch/metson/PythonBeginners/[Simon Metson's Python course],
which is run for the University's 
link:https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/[Advanced Computing Research Centre]. 

I've mentioned other useful resources. These are, in no particular order:
