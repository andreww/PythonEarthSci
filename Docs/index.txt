These pages contain the notes and excercises for 
a medium-length (two afternoon) course designed
to introduce Earth Science PhD students to the 
Python programming language and some of the 
more useful libraries. I've assumed everybody 
is happy with basic procedural programming 
(i.e. can write a loop, if statment and 
function in something like Fortran or Matlab).
The course is made up of four lectures and 
four practical sessions. Material can be 
downloaded from the links below.

* Lecture 1: An introduction to the Python 
language and landscape. The language syntax.
* Lecture 2: Using Python. Built in types,
Writing scripts and modules, the standard library.
* Lecture 3: Object oriented programming with Python.
* Lecture 4: Science with Python. NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

* Practical 1: link:ex1.html[Syntax and types]. 
(link:practical1.tgz[files]|link:practical1_solutions.tgz[solutions])
* Practical 2: link:ex2.html[Scripts and modules].
(link:practical2.tgz[files]|link:practical2_solutions.tgz[solutions])
* Practical 3: link:ex3.html[Object oriented programming].
(link:practical3.tgz[files]|link:practical3_solutions.tgz[solutions])
* Practical 4: link:ex4.html[NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib].
