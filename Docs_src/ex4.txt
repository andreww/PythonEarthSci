In the previous three practicals you have been 
introduced to the fundamentals of the Python 
language and begun to learn how to use it to 
create tools for data analysis and simulation. 
In this practical you will look at three closely 
related extension modules – modules that are not 
part of the Python standard library but are commonly 
used when writing software for science, engineering 
and mathematics. link:http://www.scipy.org/[SciPy]
provides a many tools for scientific programming. 
These include a wide range of ready to use functions 
for statistics, optimisation and minimisation, numerical 
integration, curve fitting, linear algebra, Fourier analysis, 
image and signal processing, and more. SciPy makes use 
facilities provided by link:http://numpy.scipy.org/[NumPy]. 
Chief amongst these is a high performance data object called 
an `array`. This is multi-dimensional and has elements of a 
fixed type, corresponding to a fixed storage size in memory. 
This property makes operations on the whole array much more efficient 
than operations on the built in Python data types. Many of the 
internals of NumPy and SciPy are implemented in C 
(with some Fortran) and this also yields high performance. 
NumPy and SciPy are often used with 
link:http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/[Matplotlib], 
a graphing library for Python. Data drawn on graphs 
in Matplotlib is provided in the form of NumPy `array` 
objects (but these can sometimes be generated internally 
by Matplotlib from other data types).


In this practical you will first familiarise yourself 
with the `array` object and some of the fundamental 
NumPy methods and functions. You will then learn how 
to generate simple graphs and maps based on the arrays. 
In the second part of the practical you will make use of
your `Rainfall` class from practical 3 along with functions
from SciPy to calculate and graph some properties of the 
historical rainfall record in the south of Britain.

CAUTION: Some aspects of this practical need extra 
Python modules installed beyond those which make up 
the standard library. In particular, the exercises 
make use of NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Basemap. If 
you are using your own computer basic installation 
instructions can be found link:./installation.html[here].


Exercise 1: The `array` object
------------------------------

Start a Python interpreter and import the numpy module. I 
generally find it easer to rename the module `np` by 
opting to `import numpy as np`.

* If `l = [1.0, 2.3, 4.74, 7]` what is `type(l)`? What 
about `type(l[0])` and `type(l[3])`?
* NumPy arrays can be constructed using the `array` 
class. If `a=np.array(l)`, what is `a`?
* What is `type(a)`? What about `type(a[0])` and 
`type(a[3])`? How do arrays differ from lists?
* Arrays can also be returned from other functions. 
If `b = np.zeros((4))`, and `c=np.ones((5))` what are 
`b` and `c`? What are `type(b)` and `type(c)`?
* Are NumPy arrays mutable? Can the types of the elements 
be changed? Can you change `c[2]` to be equal to `3` and `c[4]`
to be equal to the string `"one"`?
* What are `np.ones((3,3))` and `np.ones((3,3,3,3))`? What are 
the `.size` and `.shape` of these objects?
* Can you iterate through a NumPy array? What is 
`i` in each iteration of `for i in np.ones((3,3)):`?
* What is a `+ np.ones((4))`?
* What is `np.ones((4))*3`? What about 
`(np.ones((3,3))*3)*(np.ones((3,3))*2)`? 
Is this matrix multiplication or not?
* What is `a[0:2]`? What about `a[0::2]`? Does array indexing 
work in the same way as list and string indexing?

If you have used Matlab, you should find that NumPy arrays 
remind you of Matlab arrays. There are some important 
differences (square brackets rather than parenthesises, 
element wise operations rather than operators from linear 
algebra). There is even a short 
link:http://www.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users[guide to NumPy for Matlab users].

* If `theta = np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, 0.1)`, what is `theta`?
* What is `np.sin(theta)`? Assign `np.sin(theta)` and 
`np.cos(theta)` to the variables `sintheta` and `costheta`.
* We want to plot some graphs, so `import pylab`.
* Create a plot by using the `pylab.plot()` 
function thus: `pylab.plot(theta, sintheta)`.
* Display the graph with `pylab.show()`.
* Close the window. Draw the graph of latexmath:[$\cos(\theta)$].
* Can you put both lines on the same graph?

Matplotlib has two main interfaces. One, which we will examine 
later, takes an object-oriented approach with everything 
in a graph being modelled as various types of object. This 
makes it easy for your application to reuse bits of code 
when drawing graphs – you can produce a graphical 
representation of something that can sometimes be placed 
together with other graphs in a figure. The second interface 
is provided by the pylab module (part of Matplotlib). This 
takes a state-machine approach to plotting graphs 
that is similar to the approach used by Matlab.

Exercise 2: Maps
----------------

You will find a simple Python script called `draw_marble.py` 
in the `practical4` directory. Run it. What is displayed? What 
city is marked? The code is reproduced with some notes below.

[code,python]
----
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap <1>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Set up the basemap
m = Basemap(projection='nsper',lon_0=-10,lat_0=40,resolution='l',
           satellite_height=15000000) <2>

# draw parallels and meridians. 
m.drawparallels(np.arange(-90.,120.,30.),'white') <3>
m.drawmeridians(np.arange(0.,420.,60.),'white') 
# Draw the image
m.bluemarble()

# Plot a city
x, y = m(-2.58, 51.54) <4>
m.plot(x,y,'wo') 

# Show the image.
plt.show() <5>
----

<1> We need to import pyplot, numpy and basemap.
<2> This creates a new instance of the Basemap 
object. The arguments define the type of map to 
produce. `"nsper"` stands for "near sided 
perspective" (the view a satellite would see 
located over `lon_0`, `lat_0` and at a height 
of `satellite_height`). The instance `m` knows 
how to convert from geographical position to 
a location on the image that will be produced.
<3> This section adds lines of latitude and 
longitude and the background image. Notice that 
the image is distorted to correctly fit over the 
map. It is possible to distort any image to 
correctly fit over any map projection – you 
just need to know the geographical positions 
of the corners of the image. 
<4> This section plots a point on the map. We 
first need to convert from geographical 
coordinates to a location on the plotting plane. 
When used as a function, the `Basemap` instance 
`m` can do this. The two arguments are the 
longitude and latitude of a location and it returns 
the x and y coordinates of the point to be drawn. 
These can be used as arguments to locate the point
<5> Displaying the resulting map works the same as 
displaying any graph. Note that you can also put 
the figure in an image file using the `plt.savefig()`
function giving the file name as an argument.

Modify the program in order to: 

* Plot an additional city on the map. For example, 
Paris is located at 48.86 degrees N and 2.35 degrees E.
* Change the map projection. The Robinson projection 
(`projection="robin"`) was once used for global maps. 
The arguments of the constructor change with the projection 
type. The Robinson projection only needs `lon_0`, the 
longitude at the centre of the map, to be specified

The file `uki_map.py` produces a basemap of the 
British Isles. Using this file as a template, write 
a Python script that reads weather station data 
files (provided as arguments), reads them, and plots 
the location of the weather stations on the map. You 
can make use of the modules you wrote in Practical 2 
or the `Rainfall` class you wrote in Practical 3 to 
help. The map plotting should be moved into a 
subroutine (what should the arguments be?) and the 
resulting file should be importable as a module.

Modify your program to accept any number of arguments 
corresponding to a list of files of weather station 
data files. Plot all weather stations on the map. 
Change the limits of the map to only show the region 
where you have data.
