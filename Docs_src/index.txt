These pages contain the notes and excercises for 
a medium-length (two afternoon) course designed
to introduce Earth Science PhD students to the 
Python programming language and some of the 
more useful libraries. I've assumed everybody 
is happy with basic procedural programming 
(i.e. can write a loop, if statment and 
function in something like Fortran or Matlab).
The course covers:

* An introduction to the python language.
* A tour of the python landscape (range of 
interpreters and distributions, the standard
library).
* The language syntax.
* link:ex1.html[Using the interpereter to perform simple calculations].
* Python's type system.
* Writing a script.
* Modules and namespaces.
* Reading data and running analysis.
* Concepts of object-oriented programming.
* A look at Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.
* How to go further and find more help.
